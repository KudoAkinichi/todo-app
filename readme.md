This is a basic todo application with a simple backend implemented using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. The backend handles API requests for creating, updating, and deleting todo items. MongoDB is used as the database to store todo items. On the frontend, React.js is used for building the user interface, which allows users to view and interact with the todo items. The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to fetch and update todo data.\

Backend runs on the local machine (localhost:3000) to store data.
Frontend can run on any port.
